# DevCovenant Development Guide
**Last Updated:** 2026-02-11
**Version:** 0.2.6

<!-- DEVCOV:BEGIN -->
**Doc ID:** AGENTS
**Doc Type:** policy-source
**Managed By:** DevCovenant

# Message from DevCovenant's Human, read first and do not edit:

This document is the absolute source of truth for everyone who works in
this repository—human and AI alike. Think of it as the Law of the Land:
the canonical policy source for this repo, and the policies it holds are
managed by DevCovenant. Failing to follow the instructions here will
cause commits to fail.

After `AGENTS.md`, read `README.md` to learn about the project that
lives in this repository and what it aims to solve.

When you are ready to interact with DevCovenant itself, open
`devcovenant/README.md`. It can be finicky at first, but that is the
price of keeping docs, code, and features in sync under AI-assisted
development.

Taking development notes below is effectively obligatory. Updating them
frequently to describe current hurdles and events is good practice.

The editable notes section starts immediately after this message and
after the `DEVCOV:END` marker, up to the next `DEVCOV:BEGIN`.
When installing DevCovenant into a repo, the installer preserves any
existing `AGENTS.md` content in that section. Never edit between
`DEVCOV*:BEGIN` and `DEVCOV*:END` markers in any file, regardless of how
they are styled.

Have a productive session and read the docs end-to-end. Always run the
gate commands in the right order - ALWAYS start your edits session with
`start`, do your edits, then run your tests if any, then `end`. This
ensures devflow policy compliance and accepted commits. Read this entire
document and you will get it!

# EDITABLE SECTION

- 2026-01-22: Removed `DEVCOVENANT.md` and `CITATION.cff`; documentation now
  lives in `README.md` and `devcovenant/README.md`, and citation support is
  fully removed from the CLI and assets.
- 2026-01-22: SPEC/PLAN are managed alongside the other profile-driven doc
  assets. There is no include flag; profiles, policies, and config decide when
  to refresh them.
- 2026-01-22: Update runs overwrite `devcovenant/` docs while preserving
  editable notes and managed blocks in repo-level docs.
- 2026-01-26: Noted repo tests live under `/tests` outside the package and are
  driven by metadata selectors (e.g., `tests_watch_dirs`), so policy/profile
  suites can move freely without hard-coded paths.
- 2026-01-26: PLAN/SPEC now describe the scanner roadmap, the science profile
  (including a `CITATION.md` asset), the additional framework/API/database
  profiles, and the upcoming 0.2.7 metadata-driven DSL for stock policies while
  keeping custom policy prose editable in AGENTS.
- 2026-01-27: Reordered AGENTS sections and markers as intended; the
  policy block remains a special DevCovenant-managed area that general block
  automation should avoid until we flesh out the policy handling workflow.

<!-- DEVCOV:BEGIN -->

## THE DEV COVENANT

- We are human and AI developers working on this project together.
- We obey every AGENTS.md and DevCovenant instruction.
- We maintain clean repository hygiene and avoid unmanaged drift.
- We never edit content inside managed `<!-- DEVCOV* -->` blocks.

## Obligatory Workflow
Run DevCovenant gates in this sequence for repository edits:
1. `python3 -m devcovenant check --start`
2. `python3 -m devcovenant test`
3. `python3 -m devcovenant check --end`

## Managed Environment
If a managed environment is configured, run DevCovenant from that environment.
Start required services before the test gate so runtime checks execute against
the active stack.

## Table of Contents
1. [Overview](#overview)
2. [Program Overview](#program-overview)
3. [Workflow](#workflow)
4. [Policy Management and Enforcement](#policy-management-and-enforcement)

## Overview
DevCovenant converts policy prose into executable checks. This file is the
canonical policy source and operational guide for the repository.

## Program Overview
The engine loads core policies from `devcovenant/core/policies/<policy>` and
optional overrides from `devcovenant/custom/policies/<policy>`. Profiles
provide metadata and selectors that shape enforcement behavior.

## Workflow
- Run `start`, apply edits, run tests, and finish with `end`.
- After policy-text changes, run `devcovenant refresh`.
- Log every change in `CHANGELOG.md` under the current version entry.

## Policy Management and Enforcement
The policy block below is generated by DevCovenant from policy descriptors and
runtime metadata resolution.

<!-- DEVCOV:END -->`. Install/update/uninstall scripts refresh those
blocks while leaving surrounding content intact.

Every change must be logged in a new changelog entry dated today, under the
current version, with a three-line summary labeled Change/Why/Impact. Each
summary line must include an action verb listed in the summary_verbs
metadata and a Files block that lists only the touched paths for this
change. Collection prefixes (when enabled) must be logged in their own
changelog; prefixed files may not appear in the root changelog. This keeps
release notes daily, file-complete, and traceable.

## Policy: Dependency License Sync

```policy-def
id: dependency-license-sync
status: active
severity: error
auto_fix: true
enforcement: active
enabled: true
custom: false
freeze: false
dependency_files: requirements.in
  requirements.lock
  pyproject.toml
third_party_file: THIRD_PARTY_LICENSES.md
licenses_dir: licenses
report_heading: ## License Report
selector_roles: dependency
dependency_globs:
dependency_dirs:
```

Maintain the third-party license table alongside the dependency manifests
configured by the active profiles or config overrides. The policy points
reviewers to the `licenses/` directory and its `## License Report` section so
every dependency change touches both the license text and the cited manifest.


---

## Policy: Devcov Integrity Guard

```policy-def
id: devcov-integrity-guard
status: active
severity: error
auto_fix: false
enforcement: active
enabled: true
custom: false
freeze: false
policy_definitions: AGENTS.md
registry_file: devcovenant/registry/local/policy_registry.yaml
test_status_file: devcovenant/registry/local/test_status.json
watch_dirs:
watch_files:
selector_roles: watch
  watch_files
watch_globs:
watch_files_globs:
watch_files_files:
watch_files_dirs:
```

Enforce DevCovenant policy integrity: every policy must include descriptive
text, AGENTS prose must match policy descriptors, the policy registry must
stay synchronized, and test-status metadata must validate when configured.


---

## Policy: Devcov Raw String Escapes

```policy-def
id: devcov-raw-string-escapes
status: active
severity: warning
auto_fix: false
enforcement: active
enabled: true
custom: true
freeze: false
```

Warn when DevCovenant repo Python strings contain bare backslashes.
This repo-only policy keeps the raw-string guidance active without
forcing it on user repos.


---

## Policy: Devcov Structure Guard

```policy-def
id: devcov-structure-guard
status: active
severity: error
auto_fix: false
enforcement: active
enabled: true
custom: false
freeze: false
```

Ensure the DevCovenant repo keeps the required structure and tooling files.


---

## Policy: Devflow Run Gates

```policy-def
id: devflow-run-gates
status: active
severity: error
auto_fix: false
enforcement: active
enabled: true
custom: false
freeze: false
test_status_file: devcovenant/registry/local/test_status.json
required_commands: pytest
  python3 -m unittest discover -v
require_pre_commit_start: true
require_pre_commit_end: true
pre_commit_command: python3 -m pre_commit run --all-files
pre_commit_start_epoch_key: pre_commit_start_epoch
pre_commit_end_epoch_key: pre_commit_end_epoch
pre_commit_start_command_key: pre_commit_start_command
pre_commit_end_command_key: pre_commit_end_command
code_extensions:
skipped_globs: devcovenant/registry/local/**
selector_roles: skipped
skipped_files:
skipped_dirs:
```

DevCovenant must record and enforce the standard workflow: pre-commit start,
tests, then pre-commit end. The policy reads the status file to ensure each
gate ran and that no required command was skipped.
This check is enforced for every repository change (including
documentation-only updates) so the gate sequence cannot be skipped.


---

## Policy: Docstring And Comment Coverage

```policy-def
id: docstring-and-comment-coverage
status: active
severity: error
auto_fix: false
enforcement: active
enabled: true
custom: false

selector_roles: include
  exclude
  force_include
include_files:
include_dirs:
exclude_files:
exclude_dirs:
force_include_files:
force_include_dirs:
```

Source files must include a docstring or nearby explanatory comment so
intent stays visible even as code evolves. Adapters decide how each
language satisfies the requirement.

When user-facing files change (as defined by the user-facing selectors and
keywords), the documentation set listed here must be updated. User-facing
includes API surfaces, integration touchpoints, and any behavior that affects
the user's experience or workflow. Updated docs should mention the relevant
components by name so readers can find changes quickly. The policy also
enforces documentation quality standards such as required headings, a table
of contents, and minimum depth.

## Policy: Last Updated Placement

```policy-def
id: last-updated-placement
status: active

  required
include_globs: *.md
include_files:

```

Docs must include a `Last Updated` header near the top so readers can trust
recency. The auto-fix updates the UTC date for touched allowlisted docs
while respecting allowed locations.


---

## Policy: Line Length Limit

```policy-def
id: line-length-limit
status: active

force_include_files:
force_include_dirs:
```

Keep lines within the configured maximum so documentation and code remain
readable. Reflow long sentences or wrap lists rather than ignoring the limit.


---

## Policy: Managed Doc Assets

```policy-def
id: managed-doc-assets
status: active
severity: error
auto_fix: false
enforcement: active
enabled: true
custom: true
freeze: false
```

Ensure AGENTS.md, README.md, PLAN.md, SPEC.md, CHANGELOG.md, and
CONTRIBUTING.md remain the authoritative sources for their managed-block
descriptors under `devcovenant/core/profiles/global/assets/` so documentation
generation is deterministic.


---

## Policy: Managed Environment

```policy-def
id: managed-environment
status: active
severity: error
auto_fix: false
enforcement: active
enabled: false
custom: false
freeze: false
expected_paths:
expected_interpreters:
required_commands:
command_hints:
```

DevCovenant must run from the managed environment described in this
policy's metadata. Use expected_paths for virtualenv or bench roots,
expected_interpreters for explicit interpreter locations, and
required_commands or command_hints to guide contributors. When enabled
with empty metadata, the policy emits a warning so teams fill the
required context.


---

## Policy: Modules Need Tests

```policy-def
id: modules-need-tests
status: active
severity: error
auto_fix: false
enforcement: active
enabled: true
custom: false

watch_globs:
tests_watch_globs:
tests_watch_files:
force_include_files:
force_include_dirs:
```

In-scope non-test modules must have corresponding tests under configured
test roots. The rule is metadata-driven and supports mirror enforcement for
selected source roots. Python test files must use unittest.TestCase-style
definitions; pytest still runs as an execution layer.


---

## Policy: Name Clarity

```policy-def
id: name-clarity
status: active
severity: warning
auto_fix: false
enforcement: active
enabled: true
custom: false
freeze: false
exclude_prefixes: data
include_suffixes: .py

selector_roles: exclude
  include
  force_include
exclude_files:
exclude_dirs:
include_files:
include_dirs:
force_include_files:
force_include_dirs:
```

Identifiers should be descriptive enough to communicate intent without
reading their implementation. Avoid cryptic or overly short names unless
explicitly justified.


---

## Policy: No Future Dates

```policy-def
id: no-future-dates
status: active
severity: error
auto_fix: true
enforcement: active
enabled: true
custom: false
freeze: false
```

Dates in changelogs or documentation must not be in the future. Auto-fixers
should correct accidental placeholders to today’s date.


---

## Policy: No Spaghetti

```policy-def
id: no-spaghetti
status: active
severity: error
auto_fix: false
enforcement: active
enabled: true
custom: true
freeze: false
include_globs: devcovenant/core/*.py
exclude_globs: devcovenant/core/__init__.py
max_top_level_modules: 19
min_module_lines: 120
selector_roles: include
  exclude
include_files:
include_dirs:
exclude_files:
exclude_dirs:
```

Prevent core spaghetti drift by freezing the top-level module count and
rejecting tiny top-level core modules.


---

## Policy: Raw String Escapes

```policy-def
id: raw-string-escapes
status: active
severity: warning
auto_fix: false
enforcement: active
enabled: false
custom: false
freeze: false
```

Policy description pending.


---

## Policy: Read Only Directories

```policy-def
id: read-only-directories
status: active
severity: error
auto_fix: false
enforcement: active
enabled: true
custom: false
freeze: false
include_globs: __none__
include_suffixes:

selector_roles: include
  exclude
  force_include
include_files:
include_dirs:
exclude_files:
exclude_dirs:
force_include_files:
force_include_dirs:
```

Protect declared read-only directories from modification. If a directory must
be editable, update this policy definition first.


---

## Policy: Readme Sync

```policy-def
id: readme-sync
status: active
severity: error
auto_fix: true
enforcement: active
enabled: true
custom: true
freeze: false
```

Ensure `devcovenant/README.md` mirrors `README.md` with repository-only
sections removed via the `<!-- REPO-ONLY:BEGIN -->` /
`<!-- REPO-ONLY:END -->` markers. Auto-fix rewrites the packaged guide from
the repo README.


---

## Policy: Security Scanner

```policy-def
id: security-scanner
status: active
severity: error
auto_fix: false
enforcement: active
enabled: true
custom: false
freeze: false
exclude_globs: tests/**
  **/tests/**

selector_roles: exclude
  include
  force_include
exclude_files:
exclude_dirs:
include_files:

```

Scan source files for risky constructs like `eval`, `exec`, or
`shell=True`. Use the documented allow-comment only when a security
review approves the exception.


---

## Policy: Semantic Version Scope

```policy-def
id: semantic-version-scope
status: active
severity: error
auto_fix: false
enforcement: active
enabled: true
custom: false
freeze: false
version_file: devcovenant/VERSION
changelog_file: CHANGELOG.md
ignored_prefixes:
selector_roles: ignored
ignored_globs:
ignored_files:
ignored_dirs:
```

When enabled, the latest changelog entry must include exactly one
`[semver:major|minor|patch]` tag that matches the version bump. Use
`major` for API-breaking releases, `minor` for backward-compatible feature
work, and `patch` for bug fixes or documentation-only updates. The tag
must match the bump from the previous version, and the configured
version file must be updated whenever the changelog declares a release
scope. The policy ships disabled (`enabled: false`) and should only be
enabled for release processes that enforce SemVer discipline.


---

## Policy: Version Sync

```policy-def
id: version-sync
status: active
severity: error
auto_fix: false
enforcement: active
enabled: true
custom: false
freeze: false
version_file: devcovenant/VERSION
readme_files: devcovenant/README.md
  README.md

  license
readme_globs:
readme_dirs:
optional_globs:
optional_dirs:
pyproject_globs:
pyproject_dirs:
license_globs:
license_dirs:
```

All version-bearing files must match the canonical version file (default
`VERSION` or a configured override), and version bumps must move forward.
Files listed under `optional_files` are only enforced when present. The
policy also flags hard-coded runtime versions and ensures changelog
releases reflect the current version.
