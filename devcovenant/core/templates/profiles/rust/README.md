## Overview
This profile provides baseline files and metadata for rust repositories.
It is meant to be a starting point, not a full product specification.
Use it to seed consistent DevCovenant installs for projects that share
the same stack, tooling, and directory layout. If your repo mixes
languages, combine profiles and adjust the policy metadata after install.

## Template Contents
List the files that typically ship with this profile. This placeholder
README reminds maintainers to keep those assets current and aligned with
DevCovenant expectations. Templates are copied into target repos and can
be customized by the owner. Core templates may be refreshed on update
unless a custom template overrides them.

## Workflow
Start with the default templates, run the installation, then review the
generated docs, config, and policy blocks. Update metadata values for the
actual project layout, and keep templates aligned with the profile
expectations. If you add new templates, document them here so future
updates remain consistent.

## Notes
Describe any stack-specific considerations, such as build tooling, test
runners, or dependency manifests. Keep notes concrete so installers and
automation can align on expected files.
