  ## How to Log Changes
  Add one entry for each substantive change under the current version header.
  Keep entries newest-first and record dates in ISO format (`YYYY-MM-DD`).
  Each entry must include Change/Why/Impact summary lines with action verbs.
  Example entry:
  - 2026-01-23:
    Change: Updated dependency manifests and license report.
    Why: Clarified dependency sources for release audits.
    Impact: Maintainers see updated dependency state in logs.
    Files:
    requirements.in
    requirements.lock
    THIRD_PARTY_LICENSES.md
    devcovenant/core/policies/documentation_growth_tracking/\
      documentation_growth_tracking.py
    Long paths should be wrapped with a trailing \
    backslash and continued on the next indented line.
    Example:
    devcovenant/core/policies/dependency_license_sync/assets/\
      licenses/README.md
