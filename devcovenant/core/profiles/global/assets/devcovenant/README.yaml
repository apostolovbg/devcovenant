  DevCovenant is a self-enforcing policy system that keeps human-readable
  standards and automated checks in lockstep. It was born inside the Copernican
  Suite, hardened through dogfooding in production repos, and is now a
  standalone project focused on stability and portability.

  If you install DevCovenant into a repository, the user-facing guide lives
  at `devcovenant/README.md`.

  ## Overview
  DevCovenant turns policy documents into executable checks. It reads policy
  blocks from `AGENTS.md`, syncs them into a hash registry, and runs scripts that
  implement those same policies. The result is a single source of truth that
  prevents drift between documentation and enforcement.

  ## Why DevCovenant
  Most teams document rules in one place and enforce them elsewhere. That leads
  to drift, hidden requirements, and inconsistent enforcement. DevCovenant
  eliminates that by making the documentation itself the executable spec.

  ## How It Works
  1. `AGENTS.md` stores policy definitions and metadata blocks.
  2. `devcovenant/core/parser.py` extracts and hashes each policy definition.
  3. `devcovenant/registry/local/policy_registry.yaml` records policy/script
     hashes along with metadata handles, profile coverage, asset hints, and
     core/custom origin for every policy (enabled or disabled).
  4. `devcovenant/core/engine.py` runs policy scripts and reports violations.
  5. Policy scripts resolve custom → core, and custom overrides suppress core
     fixers for that policy.
  6. Pre-commit and CI run the same engine with the same policy source.

  ## CLI Entry Points
  DevCovenant ships both a console script and a module entry:
  ```bash
  devcovenant --help
  python3 -m devcovenant --help
  ```

  Both entry points execute the same CLI. Use `python3 -m devcovenant` when the
  console script is not on your PATH.

  ## Document assets
  The `global` profile installs AGENTS.md, README.md, SPEC.md, PLAN.md,
  CHANGELOG.md, CONTRIBUTING.md, and `devcovenant/README.md` by default from the
  YAML descriptors in `devcovenant/core/profiles/global/assets/`. Use the new
  `doc_assets.autogen` and `doc_assets.user` config sections to pin
  which docs the profile refreshes.
  Keep the other docs as manual overrides.
  Whenever these docs are touched, the `last-updated-placement` policy refreshes
  the `**Last Updated:** YYYY-MM-DD` header via its fixer.
  It sets the value to the current UTC date so the recorded timestamp matches the
  latest edit.

  ## Extended Docs
  Detailed guides live in `devcovenant/docs/` and are meant to be referenced
  from day-to-day development. Start here:
  - `devcovenant/docs/installation.md` for install and update flows.
  - `devcovenant/docs/config.md` for config structure and overrides.
  - `devcovenant/docs/profiles.md` for profile anatomy and overlays.
  - `devcovenant/docs/policies.md` for policy descriptors and scripts.
  - `devcovenant/docs/adapters.md` for language-specific adapter design.
  - `devcovenant/docs/registry.md` for registry files and refresh semantics.
  - `devcovenant/docs/refresh.md` for refresh-all vs registry-only runs.
  - `devcovenant/docs/workflow.md` for the enforced gate sequence.
  - `devcovenant/docs/troubleshooting.md` for common errors and fixes.

  ## Install, Deploy, Update, Upgrade
  Install copies the DevCovenant core and writes a generic config stub. It
  never deploys managed docs or assets, so you can edit the config before the
  repo goes live:
  ```bash
  devcovenant install --target /path/to/repo
  # edit devcovenant/config.yaml (set install.generic_config: false)
  devcovenant deploy --target /path/to/repo
  ```

  Update refreshes managed docs/assets/registries using the existing core
  without upgrading core files:
  ```bash
  devcovenant update --target /path/to/repo
  ```

  Upgrade replaces the core when the source version is newer, applies policy
  replacements, and then runs update:
  ```bash
  devcovenant upgrade --target /path/to/repo
  ```

  Registry-only refresh skips managed docs/assets:
  ```bash
  devcovenant refresh --target /path/to/repo
  ```

  Use `python3 -m devcovenant` for source checkouts when the console entry is
  not on PATH.

  Skip all doc/policy/metadata writes by appending `--no-touch` to install or
  update. That flag copies just the `devcovenant/` package, leaves the rest of
  the repo untouched, and still records the run in
  `devcovenant/registry/local/manifest.json` so you can finish the deploy
  later:
  ```bash
  devcovenant install --target /path/to/repo --no-touch
  devcovenant update --target /path/to/repo --no-touch
  ```


  Normalize policy metadata to include every supported key (empty values
  fall back to defaults):
  ```bash
  devcovenant normalize-metadata
  ```
  Schema defaults come from
  `devcovenant/core/profiles/global/assets/AGENTS.md`. Use `--schema` to
  point at another file if you need to seed metadata from a different
  template.

  Selector roles
  --------------
  Use `selector_roles` in policy metadata to declare selector roles. Each
  role produces `role_globs`, `role_files`, and `role_dirs`. Custom role
  names are supported and interpreted by policy scripts. Normalization will
  infer roles from legacy selector keys and insert the role triplets without
  overwriting values.


  Uninstall uses the same CLI:
  ```bash
  devcovenant uninstall --target /path/to/repo
  ```

  The installer records `devcovenant/registry/local/manifest.json` so updates and
  removals remain safe and predictable. If the target repo has no license file,
  DevCovenant installs an MIT license by default and will not overwrite an
  existing license unless forced. When `--backup-existing` is set, the
  installer renames the existing file to `*_old.*` before writing the new one.
  Managed docs such as `SPEC.md` and `PLAN.md` are part of the profile-driven
  doc asset
  graph, so they are generated (and refreshed) alongside the other auto-managed
  documents—there is no special CLI flag to toggle them. See
  `devcovenant/README.md` for the full install/update reference.


  ## Workflow
  Adoption guidance:
  - Install DevCovenant on a fresh branch.
  - Fix all error-level violations first.
  - After errors are cleared, ask the repo owner whether to address warnings or
    raise the block level.

  DevCovenant expects the following sequence in enforced repos:
  1. `python3 devcovenant/run_pre_commit.py --phase start`
  2. `python3 devcovenant/run_tests.py`
  3. `python3 devcovenant/run_pre_commit.py --phase end`

  Shortcut: `devcovenant test` runs the same pytest + unittest sequence and
  records status via the test runner wrapper.

  During `--phase end`, if pre-commit modifies files, the script automatically
  reruns `devcovenant/run_tests.py` before recording the end timestamp so
  tests always post-date any auto-fixes.

  When policy blocks change, run `devcovenant refresh_registry` to
  sync policy hashes.

  ## Core Exclusion
  User repos should keep DevCovenant core excluded from enforcement so updates
  remain safe. The installer writes the following into
  `devcovenant/config.yaml`:
  ```yaml
  devcov_core_include: false
  devcov_core_paths:
    - devcovenant/core
    - devcovenant/__init__.py
    - devcovenant/__main__.py
    - devcovenant/cli.py
    - devcovenant/run_pre_commit.py
    - devcovenant/run_tests.py
    - devcovenant/update_test_status.py
    - devcovenant/core/check.py
  ```

  Only the DevCovenant repo should set `devcov_core_include: true`. Do not
  change or prune the core path list in user repos unless you are actively
  implementing DevCovenant itself.

  Use `profiles.active` in `devcovenant/config.yaml` to extend file suffix
  coverage for multi-language projects.
  Set `version.override` when you want config-driven installs to emit a specific
  project version in generated assets (for example, `pyproject.toml`).
  Apply that override before any `VERSION` file exists.

  The DevCovenant repository activates a dedicated `devcovrepo` profile.
  It overrides `new-modules-need-tests` metadata so the `devcovenant/**` sources
  and the mirrored `tests/devcovenant/**` suites (core/custom policies and
  profiles) stay aligned.

  User repositories that do not enable `devcovrepo` instead keep the
  `devcovuser` profile active so `devcovenant/**` stays out of enforcement while
  `devcovenant/custom/**` continues to run.

  That profile also contributes a `.gitignore` fragment that keeps
  `devcovenant/config.yaml` local to this repo. User repos that do not enable
  that profile continue to commit `devcovenant/config.yaml`, ensuring their
  runtime configuration travels with their source tree.

  For a “no-touch” install, copy the `devcovenant/` package into the target repo,
  adjust `devcovenant/config.yaml` to taste, and run
  `devcovenant install --target` later. The installer honors any existing config
  unless `--force-config` is supplied, letting teams pre-seed their configuration
  before DevCovenant runs for the first time.

  ## Dependency and License Tracking
  DevCovenant tracks dependencies using the manifest files defined by the
  active profiles (for example `requirements.in`/`pyproject.toml` for Python or
  `package.json` for JavaScript). When those manifests change, the
  dependency-license-sync policy requires refreshing `THIRD_PARTY_LICENSES.md`
  (see the `## License Report` section) and the text files under `licenses/`.
  Use profile overlays or config overrides to adjust which dependency files are
  in scope for a given repo.

  ## Using DevCovenant
  Common commands:
  ```bash
  devcovenant check

  devcovenant check --mode pre-commit

  devcovenant check --fix

  devcovenant refresh_registry

  python3 devcovenant/core/refresh_registry.py
  ```
