  # Message from Human, do not edit:


  Read `README.md` and `devcovenant/README.md` first for architecture and

  workflow. This file is the canonical policy source of truth.


  Use `PROFILE_MAP.md` as the authoritative profile catalog and `POLICY_MAP.md`

  for a quick rundown of metadata handles, assets, and profile coverage for each

  policy before diving into `AGENTS.md`.


  Taking development notes is effectively obligatory; treat it as required.'
