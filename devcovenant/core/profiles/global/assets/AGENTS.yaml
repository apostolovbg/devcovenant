  # Message from DevCovenant's Human, read first and do not edit:

  This document is the absolute source of truth for everyone who works in
  this repository—human and AI alike. Think of it as the Law of the Land:
  the canonical policy source for this repo, and the policies it holds are
  managed by DevCovenant. Failing to follow the instructions here will
  cause commits to fail.

  After `AGENTS.md`, read `README.md` to learn about the project that
  lives in this repository and what it aims to solve.

  When you are ready to interact with DevCovenant itself, open
  `devcovenant/README.md`. It can be finicky at first, but that is the
  price of keeping docs, code, and features in sync under AI-assisted
  development.

  Taking development notes below is effectively obligatory. Updating them
  frequently to describe current hurdles and events is good practice.

  The editable notes section starts immediately after this message and
  after the `DEVCOV:END` marker, up to the next `DEVCOV:BEGIN`.
  When installing DevCovenant into a repo, the installer preserves any
  existing `AGENTS.md` content in that section. Never edit between
  `DEVCOV*:BEGIN` and `DEVCOV*:END` markers in any file, regardless of how
  they are styled.

  Have a productive session and read the docs end-to-end. Always run the
  gate commands in the right order - ALWAYS start your edits session with
  `start`, do your edits, then run your tests if any, then `end`. This
  ensures devflow policy compliance and accepted commits. Read this entire
  document and you will get it!
