  \n# Message from DevCovenant's Human, read first and do not edit:\n\nThis document\
  \ is the absolute source of truth for everyone who works in\nthis repository\u2014\
  human and AI alike. Think of it as the Law of the Land:\nthe canonical policy source\
  \ for this repo, and the policies it holds are\nmanaged by DevCovenant. Failing\
  \ to follow the instructions here will\ncause commits to fail.\n\nAfter `AGENTS.md`,\
  \ read `README.md` to learn about the project that\nlives in this repository and\
  \ what it aims to solve.\n\nWhen you are ready to interact with DevCovenant itself,\
  \ open\n`devcovenant/README.md`. It can be finicky at first, but that is the\nprice\
  \ of keeping docs, code, and features in sync under AI-assisted\ndevelopment.\n\n\
  Taking development notes below is effectively obligatory. Updating them\nfrequently\
  \ to describe current hurdles and events is good practice.\n\nThe editable notes\
  \ section starts immediately after this message and\nafter the `DEVCOV:END` marker,\
  \ up to the next `DEVCOV:BEGIN`.\nWhen installing DevCovenant into a repo, the installer\
  \ preserves any\nexisting `AGENTS.md` content in that section. Never edit between\n\
  `DEVCOV*:BEGIN` and `DEVCOV*:END` markers in any file, regardless of how\nthey are\
  \ styled.\n\nHave a productive session and read the docs end-to-end. Always run\
  \ the\ngate commands in the right order - ALWAYS start your edits session with\n\
  `start`, do your edits, then run your tests if any, then `end`. This\nensures devflow\
  \ policy compliance and accepted commits. Read this entire\ndocument and you will\
  \ get it!"
