  Every change must be logged in a new changelog entry dated today, under the
  current version, with a three-line summary labeled Change/Why/Impact. Each
  summary line must include an action verb listed in the summary_verbs
  metadata and a Files block that lists only the touched paths for this
  change. Collection prefixes (when enabled) must be logged in their own
  changelog; prefixed files may not appear in the root changelog. This keeps
  release notes daily, file-complete, and traceable.
