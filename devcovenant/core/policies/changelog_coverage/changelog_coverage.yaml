  Every change must be logged in the latest changelog entry dated today,
  under the current version, with every touched path listed in its Files
  block. Collection prefixes (when enabled) must be logged in their own
  changelog; prefixed files may not appear in the root changelog. This keeps
  release notes daily, file-complete, and traceable.
