  Every change must be logged in a new changelog entry dated today, under the
  current version, with a descriptive summary (minimum word count configured
  via metadata, default 10 words) and a Files block that lists only the
  touched paths for this change. Collection prefixes (when enabled) must be
  logged in their own changelog; prefixed files may not appear in the root
  changelog. This keeps release notes daily, file-complete, and traceable.
