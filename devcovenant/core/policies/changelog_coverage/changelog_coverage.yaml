  Every change must be logged in a new changelog entry dated today, under the
  current version, with a descriptive summary (at least three words) and a
  Files block that lists only the touched paths for this change. Collection
  prefixes (when enabled) must be logged in their own changelog; prefixed
  files may not appear in the root changelog. This keeps release notes daily,
  file-complete, and traceable.
