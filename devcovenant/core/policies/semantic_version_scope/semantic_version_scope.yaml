  When enabled, the latest changelog entry must include exactly one
  `[semver:major|minor|patch]` tag that matches the version bump. Use
  `major` for API-breaking releases, `minor` for backward-compatible feature
  work, and `patch` for bug fixes or documentation-only updates. The tag
  must match the bump from the previous version, and the configured
  version file must be updated whenever the changelog declares a release
  scope. The policy ships disabled (`enabled: false`) and should only be
  enabled for release processes that enforce SemVer discipline.
