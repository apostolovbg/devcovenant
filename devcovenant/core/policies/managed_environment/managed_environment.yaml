  DevCovenant must run from the managed environment described in this
  policy's metadata. Use expected_paths for virtualenv or bench roots,
  expected_interpreters for explicit interpreter locations, and
  required_commands or command_hints to guide contributors. When enabled
  with empty metadata, the policy emits a warning so teams fill the
  required context.
