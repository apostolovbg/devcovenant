# DevCovenant Waivers
**Last Updated:** 2026-01-11
**Version:** 0.1.1

Waivers provide temporary exceptions for policies that support them. Waiver
files live under `.devcovenant/waivers/` and are named after policy IDs.

Note: the long-term plan is to replace waivers with an `apply` flag in
`AGENTS.md` so policies can be disabled without adding extra files.
